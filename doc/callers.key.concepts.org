* DONE Areas of Application				       :applications:
  1. _global or focused understanding of complex software_
  2. _architecture extraction and refactoring of legacy software_
     => customer-guided architecture view extraction from source code (datamodel, functions, components, )
  3. _software security risks analysis_
     => detection of vulnerabilities and extraction of attack vectors

* User benefits						      :user:benefits:
  1. *Get the good abstraction at the right moment*
     Help the end-users to _focus on their current engineering objectives_
     _Hide all the other details_ of the existing solution.
  2. *Open and user-extensible* source code analysis solution
     Analysis results are stored incrementally in a json customizable open-format
  3. *trustable model abstractions* of complexe software implementations
     the models extracted from the source code are *correct by construction*

* Key differentiators & innovation			 :key:differentiator:
  1. *agile and goal-oriented model abstraction process from source code*
     => capability to generate customizable and resusable abstract views from source code

  2. *robust* and *scalable* source code analysis solution for large-scale software
     => it relies on a mature and up-to-date open-source compiler: *clang/LLVM*

* Comparison with concurrent tools				:competitors:

  Concurrent tools are able either to:

  1. extract low-level models from source code, without abstraction capability
     example tools: Rhapsody UML, doxygen etc... (one to one mapping)

  2. produce some proprietary abstracted views with the help of the end-user
     those views are not importable within modellers for further model refactoring
     example tools: Structure101, Lattix or Understand

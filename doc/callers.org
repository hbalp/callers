The Callers plug-in

** DONE Introduction/Executive Summary [1/1]
   - [X] Introduce the plugin
   #+BEGIN_SRC org :tangle callers.chap6.tcs.D4.2.2.org
   Callers is a static analysis plugin extending the clang/LLVM compilation framework for enabling early syntactic-based security analysis on large-scale C/C++ software.
   #+END_SRC
** DONE Aims [1/1]
   - [X] Describe the objectives of the plug-in and its relation with the security analysis of source code (what security properties are analysed)   
   #+BEGIN_SRC org :tangle callers.chap6.tcs.D4.2.2.org
* Aim
   The initial goal of the Callers plugin is to enable early security risks assessments based on the analysis of function calls dependencies.

   However, this plugin has been designed to be extensible and it could also in the future support other types of dependency like:
   - data type dependencies (inheritence, composition...)
   - control-flow dependencies (behavioral analysis based on sequence diagram generation)
   - use of shared variables
   - use of vulnerable system calls (related to specific CVEs)

   The main idea behind the Callers plugin is to perform some kind of global static link edition of the whole software
   in order to be able to capture the callers/callees relationships between each function.

   Based on this information, the tool can generate differents instances of function callgraphs, depending on the end-user analysis focus.
   Those callgraphs can also been further exploited to enable the verification of some global security properties on the software.

** TODO Functioning and user interface [0/1]
   - [ ] Describe the main functions of the plug-in and its user interface, if any.
   #+BEGIN_SRC org :tangle callers.chap6.tcs.D4.2.2.org
* Functioning and user interface
   TBC
   Function call dependencies can be analyzed at different granularity levels (function, file, directory, libraries, application).
